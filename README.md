# Linux Bash Scripts

Made by Thomas Ghysbrecht

# What is this?

These are three small bash scripts made for an asignement, these were:

1. Create a script that clones the course repositories from Github. Make sure to check if repository already exists and if it does only do a pull. The repos are https://github.com/BioBoost/embedded_systems_course and https://github.com/BioBoost/embedded_systems_tools_and_scripts

2. Create a script which copies a directory, including all its files, to the raspberry pi. Do this using the secure shell copy (scp).

3. Create a script which setups the SSH keys on the pi and also creates keys for the current user if none exist yet. Hint: you can use ssh to execute commands on a remote host.

# How do I run these?

Make sure they their permissions are correct with `chmod +x filename`. Then just execute with `./filename`. The scripts are pretty straight forward. Just run and the requiered data will be asked.
